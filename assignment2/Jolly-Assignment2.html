        <h2>Information:</h2>

        <p><b>Santana Jolly</b> is a Cloud Engineer that started her technology career in the Marine Corps. She juggles her passion for cloud infrastructure with her dedication as a mother of two beautiful and fierce girls. Education is important to her, so she is back in college working toward her Bachelor's in IT.</p>

        <p><b>Jane Goodall</b> is someone I look up to because she has committed her life to advocating and living with the chimpanzees in their natural habitat. I've looked up to her since I was a little girl. I wanted to follow her around the world and learn how to care for monkeys. 18 years later, and she is still doing her thing in the wild. </p>
